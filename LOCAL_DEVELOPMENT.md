## Introduction

This project provides a convenient [dock](https://github.com/zero-to-prod/dock) script to simplify local development workflows within Docker
containers.

You can use this script to initialize the project, manage Composer dependencies, and run tests in a consistent PHP environment.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running
- A `.env` file (created automatically via the `dock init` command, if it doesnâ€™t already exist)

## Initializing

Use the following commands to set up the project:

```shell
sh dock init
```

Update the Composer dependencies:

```shell
sh dock composer update
```

## Testing

This command runs PHPUnit inside the Docker container, using the PHP version specified in your `.env` file.
You can modify or extend this script to include additional tests or commands as needed.

```shell
sh dock test
```

Run the test suite with all versions of php:

```shell
sh test.sh
```

## Configuration

Before starting development, verify that your `.env` file contains the correct settings.

You can specify which PHP version to use for local development, debugging, and Composer operations by updating these variables in your `.env` file:

```dotenv
PHP_VERSION=8.1
PHP_DEBUG=8.1
PHP_COMPOSER=8.1
```

Make sure these values reflect the PHP versions you intend to use.
If the `.env` file does not exist, run the `sh dock init` command to create one from the `.env.example` template.
